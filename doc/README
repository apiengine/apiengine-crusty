Welcome to "crusty", a command line tool for accessing RESTful APIs using curl.

You will need to INSTALL and then CONFIGURE for the REST calls you want to
make:

    INSTALL
    CONFIGURE

Installation covers setting up jshon and jansson, third party tools for JSON
processing.  Configuration covers defining calls to the API you want to talk
to, defining PATHs and finally specifying your endpoints.

So what's with the name "crusty"?

Well, it's a curl-y, REST-y type of thing, and "crusty" is a name which
_might_ make Morgan (that's Morgan of the66bus.com Morgan) proud.

If you have any questions or want to get involved we'd love to hear from you
at ApiEngine.  So, don't be shy, email the crew - cogs@apiengine.io :-)

Have fun!
