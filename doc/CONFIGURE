There are 3 parts to configuration:

    Setting your PATHs
    Creating your API calls
    Defining the structure of your API calls

Throughout this document we're going to use as an example the66bus.com as
the domain with /status, /session and /driver as the REST resources we want
to smash with "crusty".  Morgan is the driver of the bus.

Setting your PATHs
------------------

So, you have some REST apis you want to make calls against.  Head in api/ and
create a directory for your domain.  In Morgan's case he would create:

    $ mkdir api/the66bus.com

All the commands to poke the REST services at your domain will reside within
this directory.  So next we add a PATH in your .profile, .bash_profile, .zshrc
or equivalent:

    export PATH=/home/morgan/repos/apiengine-crusty/api:$PATH

Creating your API calls
-----------------------
