There are 3 parts to configuration:

    Setting your PATHs.
    Creating your API calls
    Defining the structure of your API calls

Throughout this document we're going to use as an example the66bus.com as
the domain with /status, /session and /driver as the REST resources we want
to smash with "crusty".

Setting your PATHs
